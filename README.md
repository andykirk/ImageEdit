ImageEdit
=========

PHP, [Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/) and [JCrop](http://deepliquid.com/content/Jcrop.html) Image Editor.
With a small font made by [IcoMoon](http://icomoon.io/) using a variety of the fonts supplied there.

The editor could be used as a standalone page, embedded as part of a page or form, or displayed via a modal.

The standalone example code provided in this repo should be enough to give you an idea of how to get this up and running.

Checkout a [demo](http://www.grudlight-design.co.uk/demos/ImageEdit/) of this in use in a modal.
